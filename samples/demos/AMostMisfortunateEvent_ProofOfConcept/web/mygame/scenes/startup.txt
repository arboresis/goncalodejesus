A splashing sound outside brings you out of the shower's relaxing trance. You've been here for over an hour! You grab a towel and rush out of the bathroom door, filling the bungaloo with steam.

Your hands reach out for the chair where you left your clothes.

Nothing.
*line_break
Nothing?!

You look at the corner where you left your bags, only to find them missing as well. In their place, only an oversized t-shirt, and a note:

Fortune favors the clothed. ;)
*line_break
-S

You peek outside, to find the party raging beyond the shared balcony. People are dancing and partying near the pool, while others stand on the balcony just outside, holding cocktails and chatting.

One of them turns around, unknowingly forcing you to duck under your window to remain unseen.

You close the curtains, and try to figure out a game plan.

For the night, you'll be...
*choice
	*selectable_if (1 = 2) #[Do not pick] Hanging out by the pool side.
		And what will you wear?
		*choice
			#The oversized t-shirt.
				*set currentclothes "oversized t-shirt"
			#I'll take my chances with the towel.
				*set currentclothes "wrapped towel"
	*selectable_if (1 = 2) #[Do not pick] Hanging outside, on the balcony.
	
	#Staying inside and not to embarrass myself to death!
		You'll sort this mess out tomorrow.
		*line_break
		You're not about to run into a crowd wearing nothing but a thin shirt.
		
		*page_break
		
		Lacking any other clothing, you put on the baggy t-shirt, and head into the bathroom. You roll a toilet paper sheet into two small spheres, and plug them into your ears.
		
		They're not the earplugs you paid a kidney for, but those are nowhere to be found, so these will have to do.
		
		The sounds and energy from the party outside seem to fade away as you lay down. The sheets are soft, and the pillow feels like your own bit of cloud. Its foam moulds around your head as your thoughts begin to drift away.
		
		*page_break The following day...
