Daylight soothingly makes its way into the room, and your body slowly starts coming back to life.

You can't remember sleeping this well since you were a teen. Still a bit dazed, you open your eyes. You let yourself stay like this for a while.

And for a moment, it almost seems like you don't have a "bags missing, no clothes to wear" situation to solve.

You pull out your makeshift earplugs, and get up. Time to face the day.

*page_break

You take a peek out the window right beside the bed. It seems like a hurricane passed by during the night.

Clothes on the floor, drinks spilled over, and a handful of people passed out on the floor paint the picture of a wild party last night.

*fake_choice
	#Damn... Looks like I missed quite the party. Wish I'd gone out.
		It was the first party, but it doesn't seem like it will be the last, for sure. There'll be other opportunities for you to shine.
	#I don't regret staying in. I party quite a bit, but only with people I'm comfortable with.
		And if you're not comfortable surrounded by strangers, you'd definitely not be comfortable surrounded by strangers [i]in just a t-shirt[/i].
	#I'm glad I stayed inside. Not my type of party.
		Maybe because it was the first day; maybe it'll be like this every night. You can only hope there will be quieter nights out.

You hear a faint sound that you can barely make out. You almost discard it as the sea waves in the distance, but no.

This is coming from inside.

You look around the room, and notice a couple of bags at the entrance. The carpeted floor is wet near the door, and a dripping trail leads towards the bathroom.

You grab a nearby lamp, and proceed carefully.

*page_break

Little by little, you poke the bathroom door open.

There's no one here.

You peek at the shower, and through the transparent doors, you find a scantily clad man sat inside.

He is completely asleep, and shows no reaction to your presence.

	*selectable_if (1 = 2) #[Do not pick] I turn on the shower to cold. Maybe that'll wake him up.
		*set gaveTrevorColdShower true
		You tiptoe your way around the bathroom, turn on the cold shower, and close the door.
		
		In a zip, the man jumps up and shakes his head, letting out something that can only be described somewhere between a scream and a whimper.
		
		'What the hell are you doing here?', he asks.
		
		*fake_choice
			#'What the hell are [b]you[/b] doing here?'
				'What the hell are [b]you[/b] doing here?', you ask.
				
				'This is my room.'
		
				'No, this is [b]my[/b] room.'
				
				He takes a deep breath, turns his face towards the cold water, then turns back to you.
				
				'I feel like we're going on in circles.', he calmly admits.
				*line_break
				'If you check near my bag, I think I left my keycard on the floor somewhere around.'
				*page_break
			#'Why are [b]you[/b] in [b]my[/b] shower?'
				'Why are [b]you[/b] in [b]my[/b] shower?', you ask.
				
				'This is my shower, because it's in my room. You can check the keycard, I think I left it lying around somewhere.'
				*page_break
			#'Good, you're alive. Thought you were dead.'
				'Good, you're alive. Thought you were dead.', you sarcastically remark.
				
				'No, no', he laughs.
				*line_break
				'I [i]do[/i] have to admit that I was so drunk that I thought I'd only wake up on the fourth day, though.'
				
				You both laugh.
				
				'I'm sorry, how did you get in here, again? Did I leave the door unlocked?'
				
				'This is my room', you firmly inform.
				
				'That can't be right. It's not what my keycard said, at least.
				
				'You [i]were[/i] quite drunk, as we've established.'
				
				'Check near the door, I must have left my keycard on the floor.'
				*page_break
	#I wake him up gently. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for this.
		You walk up to the shower doors, and prod his foot with yours.
		
		At first, he doesn't move, but with persistence, his arm moves.
		
		Then, an eye opens. Reluctantly, of course.
		
		*fake_choice
			#[Flirting] 'Good morning, sweetheart. Last night was amazing.'
				'Good morning, sweetheart. Last night was amazing.'
				
				'Wh-- Yeah, yes. I'm truly sorry, I'm really not like this, but who are you?', he asks with the most confused look on his face.
				
				'Your hip movement could use some work, though', you say jokingly.
				
				His confusion blends with the migraine, and he's at a loss for words.
				
				'I'm kidding, lover boy. You're in my room. How did you even get here?'
				
				'I... I think this is my room, isn't it? I took my while finding it, but I'm pretty sure I got the right one.'
				
				'Well, you somehow opened the door, so you must have done something.'
				
				'If you'd like, you can check my keycard. You can find it somewhere near the door.'
				*page_break
			*selectable_if (1 = 2) #[Do not pick] 'Excuse me, sir, why are you here?'
				'Excuse me, sir, why are you here?', you ask.
				
				'Oh, I must have passed out or something. Why are [b]you here?'
				
				'It's my room.'
				
				'I'm pretty sure it's mine. At least that's what it said on the keycard. Should be around the door, somewhere.'
				*page_break
	*selectable_if (1 = 2) #[Do not pick] I scream from the top of my lungs.
		*set ranAway true
		You scream as much as you can and run out of the bathroom.
		
		The man shakes his head, and gets up in a hurry.
		
		As you scream towards the door, you notice that you wouldn't be leaving much to the imagination if you were hopping and running around in just this t-shirt.
		
		You look around for anything you can cover yourself up with.
		*page_break
		*goto seeKeycard

You approach the door area, and take a look around.

*label seeKeycard
You spot something sticking out from underneath a shirt on the floor.

You lift the shirt, and find a keycard. You check the number, and it's for this room.

You glance at the bedside table, and find that yours is still there.

You were double booked.
*page_break

*label keycardFound
The man steps out of the bathroom, and stands looking at you. His boxer shorts and a red sash around his torso are the only clothes that conceal very reduced parts of the otherwise exposed skin.

His figure stands tall against the door frame, and his toned arms are folded across his burly chest.
*line_break
One athletic leg in front of the other, he stares at you with big hazel-colored eyes. His head is cocked to the left, and he runs his fingers through thin blonde hair before saying 'Let me just change clothes, and I can head to the reception and ask for a new room. We'll sort all this out.'

*fake_choice
	#[Flirting] 'Well, now... We wouldn't want to impose.'
		'Well, now... We wouldn't want to impose', you slyly answer.
		
		His face turns to confusion, then a surprise which he tries to hide.
		
		'Yeah, yeah. And everyone's already settled in, I'd possibly be crashing someone else's room. And it could [i]very[/i] easily be someone less attractive than you', he replies as he takes a step towards you.
		
		You take a step yourself.
		*line_break
		'Oh, I understand. That would be bad for you, and I don't want that.'
		
		'Thank you for understanding', he concludes with a laugh.
		
		Now a couple of steps away from each other, you trade a couple of glances as his head tilts to the other side.
		
		*page_break
		
		He steps forward and extends a hand.
		*line_break
		'The name's Trevor, by the way.'
		
		[i]Trevor? [b]The[/b] Trevor? The shy kid whose highest accomplishment was finishing second-to-last in gym class long jump?[/i]
		
		[i]You suppose he hasn't recognized you yet. He may be a bit pissed to find out he's sharing a bedroom with one of the masterminds of the prank that made him skip school for a week out of embarrassment.[/i]
		
		[i]Then again, maybe it's water under the bridge. It's not like it was a huge prank, he just took it way too seriously.[/i]

			#[Lean in and give him a kiss on the cheek] 'It's a pleasure to meet you, Trevor.'
				'It's a pleasure to meet you, Trevor', you say as you lean in and plant a kiss on his cheek.
				
				He's taken aback a bit as he lets out a nervous smile, and you share a brief moment before you pull away.
				
				'I'm hoping you can take a few breaks from partying all night to get to know me better, Trevor.'
				
				'I reckon I can do that. Maybe I'll party a bit with you as well.'
				
				*fake_choice

						'You see, I'm more of a "stay in" person, I don't usually go out', you reply.

*label trevorBedBoundarySetting
Now thorougly flushed, you quickly turn around and walk towards the bed, holding your t-shirt down whenever it feels like revealing more than you want.

You glance at a bedside standing mirror to find Trevor debating with himself whether or not he should look at you as you walk away.

'Focus up, Trevor-boy!', you call out.

Startled to learn that you could see him through the mirror he hadn't noticed, he swiftly acts busy, taking off the red sash around his body. Much to your disappointment, he picks a shirt off of his bag and puts it on.

You pick up one of the many pillows atop the bed.
*line_break
'Do you want to ask for single beds?', you ask.

He ruffles his hair a bit, and gives you the sweetest look.

'We [i]are[/i] still trying to save the hotel some trouble, right?'

*fake_choice
	#[Play along] 'I guess we are.'
		'I guess we are', you reply, unsure of where this is going.
		
		'If you're okay with that, we can both sleep there', he suggests.
		*line_break
		'We can make a wall straight down the middle.'
		
		'Right. We'll get a couple of pillows...'
		
		'... A couple of towels...', he continues.
		
		'And to each their own side.'
		
		'And that's that. No crossing.'
		*line_break
		He approaches you with his pinky out.
		
		'No crossing.'
		*line_break
		Your fingers lock, and the promise is made.
		
		[i]And we all know that pinky swears are made to last.[/i]
