<b>Game Design / File System Philosophy</b>
	Spinshot's file system is conceived to seamlessly integrate the customization-first mindset of the game's design. The file system philosophy consists of having exposed database files, available for editing at any moment.
	In practice, this means that players have permanent access to any key files the database uses. The responsibility of keeping the file system sane and readable falls upon the user, but this method provides the highest level of customization, from players, to teams, and even rivalries and venues.
	As such, a saved game would look like this, for example:

↳ <saved game folder path>
  ↳ SavedGame1
    ↳ SavedGame1.save
    ↳ SavedGame1.competitions
    ↳ SavedGame1.clubs
    ↳ SavedGame1.rivalries
    ↳ SavedGame1.venues
    ↳ SavedGame1.people

	Alterations in the file system would only be read when the saved files are reloaded, but the game should be ready to handle on-the-fly changes. There are, of course, limits to this approach - which is why the file system's maintenance falls upon the player. This should be made clear when a player tampers with a saved file's contents.
